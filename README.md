A little bit about me...

- :keyboard: &nbsp; I'm a software engineer at [Daily Harvest](https://www.dailyharvest.com).
- I like buying NFTs but also like keeping track of what I spent... so i brought [Crypto Cost Basis Engine](https://cryptocost.netlify.app/) into the world.
- :seedling: &nbsp; [My friend](https://github.com/EricNatelson) and I made [NYC Restaurant Info](https://www.nycrestaurant.info) because i got sick of trying to figure out what's open. [Here's the code](https://github.com/benhurley/nyc-restaurant-info).
- :zap: &nbsp; Fun fact: My first computer was a 1998 Gateway PC (running Windows 98, of course).
