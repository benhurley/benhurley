### Hi Friends 👋

<!--
**benhurley/benhurley** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here you can find the personal projects I tinker around with (some old, some new). Here's a snapshot of current events:

- 🌱 My friend and I created a web app to find up-to-date restaurant info in nyc, specifically around [outdoor dining](https://github.com/benhurley/food-feels)
- 💬 Ask me about git and I'll teach you some fun and helpful tips/tricks.
- 📫 How to reach me: benfromtech@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: My first computer was a 1998 Gateway PC (running Windows 98, of course).
