### Hi Friends ðŸ‘‹

**benhurley/benhurley** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here you can find the personal projects I tinker around with (some old, some new). Here's a snapshot of current events:

- ðŸŒ± Co-creator of [NYC Restaurant Info](https://github.com/benhurley/food-feels) (a website to provide near-real-time NYC restaurant statuses during Covid-19).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about git and I'll teach you some fun and helpful tips/tricks.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: benfromtech@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first computer was a 1998 Gateway PC (running Windows 98, of course).
