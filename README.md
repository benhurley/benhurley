### Hi Friends ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**benhurley/benhurley** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here you can find the personal projects I tinker around with (some old, some new). Here's a snapshot of current events:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on sharpening my Javascript and React skills. I'm also brushing up on previous AWS expertise. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how best to use React Hooks in a large, enterprise settings. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a fun side-project, especially using Flask or React. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about git and I'll teach you some fun and helpful tips/tricks.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: benfromtech@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first computer was a 1998 Gateway PC (running Windows 98, of course). What was yours?
